# VHDL project

Topic: Sender and receiver of the Morse code.

### Team members

* Dmitrii Semenov (responsible for top level simulation, VHDL programing)
* Roman Lunin (responsible for VHDL programing, github decoration)

## Theoretical description and explanation

Enter a description of the problem and how to solve it.

## Hardware description of demo application

Insert descriptive text and schematic(s) of your implementation.

## Software description

Put flowchats/state diagrams of your algorithm(s) and direct links to source/testbench files in `src` and `sim` folders. 

## Component(s) simulation

### Button driver
The first part of our project is button driver. It is a block that automatically detects if input button `BTND` is pressed by user. Block also determines if button pressed for short period of time (dot) or for a long period of time (dash). Length of determination of a dot is set by a constant `g_LENGTH` at the top level. 

## Instructions

Write an instruction manual for your application, including photos or a link to a video.
